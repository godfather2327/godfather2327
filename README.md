👋 Hi, I’m Harshith Sai V, a passionate Masters student in Computer Science, exploring the realms where innovation intersects with security. By day, I dive deep into the intricacies of computer systems, algorithms, and cutting-edge technologies. By night, I don the hat of a vigilant guardian, wielding my expertise as a Graduate Information Security Assistant to safeguard digital infrastructures against emerging threats.

🔐 With a fervent interest in Cybersecurity, I'm on a mission to fortify digital ecosystems and defend against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. From dissecting the latest malware strains to architecting robust security protocols, I thrive in the dynamic world of Information Security.

🌱 Currently, I'm honing my skills in Golang, exploring its potential to revolutionize software development with its simplicity and efficiency. Whether it's crafting elegant solutions to complex problems or delving into the intricacies of distributed systems, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible.
